# Quant Portfolio

This repository collects my **quantitative finance research projects**, written in Python, C++, and Jupyter Notebooks.  
Each submodule explores a different area of quantitative analysis, simulation, or algorithmic trading.

---

## 📘 Overview

The goal of this repository is to bring together independent experiments and tools related to **quantitative modeling**, **portfolio optimization**, and **market simulation**.  
Many of these scripts were built as learning or research projects while studying at **Imperial College London (MSc Applied Computational Science & Engineering)**.

## 📂 Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `MeanVariancePortfolioOptimiser/` | Classical portfolio optimization using Markowitz mean–variance theory, with efficient frontier visualization. |
| `BookieArbitrage/` | Sports-betting arbitrage detector simulating cross-bookmaker odds inefficiencies. *(May later move to its own repo)* |
| `EuropeanOptionPricer/` | Option pricing via Black–Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulation. |
| `CovarianceMatrixExplorer/` | Tools for computing and visualizing asset covariance, correlation, and PCA decomposition. |
| `BacktestStrategy/` | Simple backtesting engine for trading strategy evaluation. |
| `SpaceWeatherVolatility/` | Experimental model testing relationships between geomagnetic indices and market volatility. *(May move to its own repo)* |
| `brownian_motion.py`, `monte_carlo.py`, `financial_time_series.py` | Core scripts for simulating stochastic processes and synthetic market data. |
